"""The period search: `kepmodel`'s astrometric periodogram, one system at a time.

This is `src/run_kepmodel_periodograms.py` reduced to its per-system core, with
the population loop, the HDF5 readers and the CSV writer removed -- those are
`shards.py` and `writers.py` here. The statistic is unchanged, and five
conventions are worth restating because they are what the numbers mean.

**Model.** The five linear columns fitted here (parallax factor, two position
offsets, two proper-motion terms, each projected on the scan angle) span exactly
the same subspace as `fitting.astrometric_design_matrix`, and `kepmodel`'s four
periodogram columns (`cth cos nu t, sth cos nu t, cth sin nu t, sth sin nu t`)
span exactly the in-house pipeline's circular Thiele-Innes columns. With
fixed formal weights the two periodograms are therefore the *same statistic* in
exact arithmetic, computed along completely different routes.

**Grid: kepmodel's own, no interpolation.** Every number reported here is an
exact `kepmodel` evaluation on a uniform frequency grid. The periodogram is not
resampled onto a log-uniform period grid, and the classifier runs on the trial
periods `kepmodel` actually visited. See `grid.py`.

**Scale.** `kepmodel` returns the normalised power `z = 1 - chi2(nu)/chi2_base`
in [0, 1]; the classifier wants a Delta-chi^2 curve, so `z * chi2_base` is what
is reported and stored. `chi2_base` is the profiled chi^2 of the five-parameter
model in the whitened metric -- exactly the in-house `chi2_5par` when no jitter
is fitted -- so `WIDTH_DELTA = 4` and `DELTA_POWER_UNIMODAL = 10` keep their
meaning.

**Conditioning (a real difference, not a rounding one).** Where the 9-column
design is well conditioned -- P below a few tens of years -- `kepmodel` and the
in-house periodogram agree to ~1e-7 of the peak at identical trial periods.
Beyond P ~ 100 yr they do not, and `kepmodel` is the one that is right: as P
grows past the baseline the four orbit columns collapse onto the position and
proper-motion columns (cos nu t -> 1, sin nu t -> nu t) and the 4x4 normal
matrix goes near-singular. The in-house code damps that with a ridge, which
progressively suppresses the long-period tail; `kepmodel` solves it
unregularised and tracks an SVD reference to ~1e-4 out to 3300 yr. The visible
consequence is confined to systems that are already classified `broad`: the
ridged version's tilted plateau plants a spurious interior argmax around
100-300 yr where the true curve is flat to the grid edge. `klass`, `top_power`
and the detection flag are unaffected; `best_period` for a `broad` system is
not, and should not be read out of either table.

**Width metric.** `find_peaks` is reused unchanged -- it works off actual
log-period values and is grid-agnostic. The competitive-width metric is not:
the in-house `period_constraint` measures the competitive region as the
*fraction of grid points* within `WIDTH_DELTA` of the maximum, which is a
log-period width only on a uniform log grid, and on the segmented grid that
would badly understate a long-period plateau. `period_constraint` below
measures the same quantity as an actual log-period measure -- a sum of cell
widths -- and reduces to the baseline definition on a uniform log grid.
