"""The pieces of `src/epochalypse_fitting.py` this run needs, and nothing else.

Six functions, copied verbatim in behaviour from the repository's analysis
module: the along-scan design matrix, the weighted least-squares chi^2, the
acceleration test, the peak finder, and the truth check. They are duplicated
rather than imported for two reasons. `epochalypse_fitting` imports h5py and
carries the whole serial-catalog HDF5 reader stack, none of which exists on the
shard side; and `periodograms/` has to be a tree that can be copied to a cluster
on its own.

What is deliberately *not* copied is `epochalypse_fitting.astrometric_periodogram`
-- the in-house profile-likelihood period search. That is the thing this package
replaces, and `periodogram.py` explains why.

The acceleration channel, by contrast, is the *same code* in both pipelines, so
a difference between the two output tables is attributable to the period search
rather than to the analysis built around it.
