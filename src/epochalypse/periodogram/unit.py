"""One work unit: search every system in one shard (or one part of one).

This is the whole of the compute. `scripts/characterize_mpi.py` is a loop over
`run_unit` and a `gather` at the end; there is no other work in this pipeline.
It lives in the package rather than in a script because the MPI driver and the
tests both call it -- importing it from a script is what used to require a
`sys.path` hack in the test suite.
