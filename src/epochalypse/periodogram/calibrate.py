"""Detection thresholds, calibrated on the companion-free control.

The periodogram Delta-chi^2 is maximized over ~16,600 trial periods, so under
the null it is inflated by the look-elsewhere effect and is *not* chi^2_4
distributed. It is further inflated because the catalog's noise model injects
scatter at the sigma_UEVA scale but reports the smaller sigma_formal, and the
search uses fixed 1/sigma_formal^2 weights, so it over-fits that excess. Neither
effect has a closed form worth trusting at this grid size, so the thresholds are
measured: the quantile of `0_companion` that leaves a `TARGET_FP` false-positive
rate.

Two things make that calibration stronger here than in the 10,000-system
notebook it comes from. The control is the *same 5.7 M stars* as the two
companion populations -- the generator draws all three from the same parent
sample, so every star's parallax, transit count and per-epoch precision appears
in the null and in the signal. And the quantile is measured on 5.7 M systems
rather than 10,000, so the 99.5th percentile is set by ~29,000 systems in the
tail rather than by ~50: the threshold stops being the noisy quantity it is at
notebook scale.

The budget is split evenly between the two independent channels -- the
periodogram peak and the acceleration test -- so each gets `TARGET_FP / 2` and
the union comes out at `TARGET_FP`. The realized rate is measured after the
fact rather than assumed, because the channels are not quite independent.

The thresholds MUST be recalibrated for any change in the grid, the bounds, or
the noise model. The look-elsewhere inflation grows with the trial count, and
a different noise model would move the orbit channel by orders of magnitude.
