"""The trial-period grid: one uniform frequency grid per log-period segment.

`kepmodel` advances the trial frequency by a *fixed* step -- it propagates
`cos nu t` / `sin nu t` by a rotation rather than recomputing them -- so it
evaluates only on uniform frequency grids. A single such grid, the way the
Gaia/OHP tutorial sets one up, is fine for detection but is the wrong sampling
for *this* measurement,
because the classification spans 7.8 decades in period: a uniform frequency
step fine enough for 44-minute orbits resolves log-period to ~1e-5 dex there
(pointlessly fine) and to ~0.1 dex at 3300 yr, leaving a handful of samples in
the last decade -- and the last decade is where the significant-but-unlocalized
systems live.

So the search uses `N_SEGMENTS` uniform frequency grids, one per equal interval
of log-period, and reports the union of their sample points. Every sample is
still a native kepmodel evaluation; the segments only let the frequency step be
refreshed as the trial period grows.

The grid depends on `config.P_MIN`, `P_MAX` and `N_SEGMENTS` and on nothing
else -- not on the star, not on its epochs -- so it is global to a run. That is
what lets the stored power arrays carry no period axis of their own.
