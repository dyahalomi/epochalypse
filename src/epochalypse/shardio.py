"""One buffered parquet writer, for the three stages that each wanted their own.

Every parallel stage writes the same way: buffer rows, flush a row group when
the buffer fills so peak memory stays bounded regardless of how much work lands
in a rank, write to `.tmp`, and rename on success. The rename is what makes
`--skip-existing` trustworthy -- a rank killed mid-write leaves no file rather
than a truncated one that looks complete.

Subclasses supply only `_table(rows)`: how a list of buffered items becomes an
Arrow table. `astrometry.ShardWriter` builds epochs from DataFrames, the
characterization writer joins truth columns, the power writer packs fixed-size
lists -- all three used to carry their own copy of everything above.
